## ⚠️ Consequences of Not Applying Patches

1. **Security Vulnerabilities:** Unpatched systems can be exploited by hackers to gain unauthorized access.
2. **Malware Attacks:** Attackers exploit known vulnerabilities using malware, such as ransomware.
3. **Data Breaches:** Sensitive data may be stolen, leading to financial and reputational losses.
4. **Downtime:** Exploits can lead to system crashes, resulting in operational disruption.

## 🛡️ Best Practices for Patch Management

1. **Asset Inventory:** Know what hardware and software you have.
2. **Regular Scanning:** Use tools to identify missing patches.
3. **Patch Testing:** Test in controlled environments before deploying.
4. **Automated Tools:** Use patch management software (e.g., WSUS, SCCM, or third-party tools).
5. **Schedule Regular Updates:** Plan patch cycles during low-usage hours.
6. **Audit and Documentation:** Maintain records of applied patches and compliance status.

## 🧪 Real-World Example

**WannaCry Ransomware Attack (2017)**  
- Exploited an SMB vulnerability in Windows systems.
- Microsoft had released a patch before the attack, but many systems remained unpatched.
- Affected 200,000+ computers across 150 countries.

**Lesson:** Timely patching could have prevented massive damages.
